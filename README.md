# WeatherApp
Coding Assignment for Accenture by John Goh

I have writen most of my thought process and reflections in OpenWeatherMap/AppDelegate.Swift
You can take a look the git history of this repo to see my thoughts at different stages of development.

To run:
1) Open OpenWeatherMap.xcodeproj with the latest version of XCode
2) Fix any provisioning profile issues
3) Run the app on a simulator or physical device


Thank you for your time.
